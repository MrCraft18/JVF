TODO:

DONE | Seperate Deals and Posts into different collections
DONE | When post is a type of deal it should be checked if a existing deal document for its deal by comparing extracted info from post to info inside of the deals documents already exists then if not it will try to create a new one.
DONE (I guess?) | Deal documents should contain the metadata for arv percentage, within city list (and maybe some kind of confidence value?)
DONE | Add GPT checker to post to see if it has more than 1 parcel/deal (actually really just more than 1 DEAL) and ignore it if it does for now and Ill implement functionality for that in the future.
DONE | Functionality to handle multiple parcels/deals in a post
DONE | Subsidize chat gpt prompts for extracting data
Check GPT extracted data for valid city and valid state.
DONE | Set up delay for querying emails in post comments after time has passed so people have time to comment emails.
DONE | Cron Job every day that gets post comments for posts that are 3 days old
DONE | Need sorting value for deal created age (3 days, 1 week, 1 month, etc)

DONE | Mess with component loading in router.html
DONE | When nav-bar and title-bar are used for navigation in the app use component swapping instead of actual browser navigation.
DONE | Emails need to be associated with cities from the deal they were posted with. And if they dont have a deal then they are associated with the state group.
DONE | Add Florida Groups to group lists. Organge County, Orlando.



Add user query instances for switching between multiple user defined queries



Lowest similarity for duplicate posts needs to be > threshold
HIGHER SCORE FOR DUPLCATE POSTS IS BETTER

Highest similarity for NON-duplicate posts needs to be < thresold
LOWER SCORE FOR NON DUPLCATE POSTS IS BETTER



LOW PRIORITY | Make deals list live update when new deals are found | Load images in deal-view (GridFS) | Make a map where deals that have full address are displayed on. (Extreme low priority) | Streamline adding facebook groups for branching into any market.

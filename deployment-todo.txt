Elijah Talking Points:

The scraping computer that was taken down? Not Crucial
The HTTPS certrificate/domain stuff in general | Just have to add on?
Email scraping? Omit
Should we continue scraping florida? Omit
Should we ask users what area they want deals in and only have deals in that region visible to them?
Get external hosting (not hosting from my laptop)
We should figure out a charging strategy for teams who want to buy the software and have multiple users for their organization


Check if newwestern guy wants teams of users or every user is individual
Elijah made the decision for to have every user seperate.
